Iterates through all the reactions in `model` and checks if the charges across
each reaction balance. Returns a list of reaction IDs that are charge
unbalanced, which is empty if the test passes. 

Optionally, pass a list of reactions to ignore in this process through
`ignored_reactions`. It makes sense to include the biomass and 
exchange reactions in this list (default).
